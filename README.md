# Melon Block Drop
A Forge mod to drop melon blocks instead of slices

Built against: 1722 (1.8.9)

## A quick overview

### Why?

Well, imagine you're a farmer. You're out in your field somewhere, picking your crops yourself; Minecraft is based in medieval times.

You get your wheat, your carrots, your pumpkins, and your potatoes. You go and touch a melon and **IT EXPLODES INTO SLICES**

Does that sound right to you? No? Well, that's what happens in Minecraft - Without this mod ;)

### What... What have you done to my precious melons?

Don't worry, your melon farm is fine! Instead of melons exploding, they will now drop melon blocks.

#### But melon blocks can't be split if you can't break them!

That's where the new crafting recipes come in. If you're disappointed by the output, try scattering some more melons around the crafting grid. You may get a nice surprise
